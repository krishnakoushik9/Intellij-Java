## Welcome to IntelliJ-Java ☕

This GitBook is a personal collection of Java programs, concepts, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) implementations that I'm learning through my development journey.

Every concept is accompanied by source code and short explanations, tested using IntelliJ IDEA on Ubuntu Linux.

### Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java

This section covers the core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) that are essential for technical interviews, competitive programming, and backend development.

All code is implemented in Java with a focus on **clarity**, **time and space complexity analysis**, and **real-world problem-solving patterns**.

Arrays and strings are the foundation of DSA.

**Concepts Covered:**

* One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays
* String manipulations using `String`, `char[]`, and `StringBuilder`
* Input/output techniques for arrays and strings
* Time and space complexity basics

**Problems:**

* Linear Search and Binary Search
* Maximum Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)
* Two Sum, Prefix Sum, Sliding Window

***

#### 🔁 2. Recursion

Understanding recursion is critical for divide-and-conquer problems.
